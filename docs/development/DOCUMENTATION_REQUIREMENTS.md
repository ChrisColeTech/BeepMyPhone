# BeepMyPhone Documentation Requirements

This document defines the comprehensive requirements for all documentation in the BeepMyPhone project, ensuring consistent, high-quality documentation across all components (backend, frontend, mobile, electron).

## üéØ Project Overview

BeepMyPhone is a PC-to-phone notification forwarding application that operates entirely over local networks without cloud services. The project consists of multiple components that must be documented according to strict standards to ensure maintainability, clarity, and implementation success.

## üìö Universal Documentation Requirements

### **Documentation Structure**

Each component (backend, frontend, mobile, electron) must have its own `docs/` folder containing exactly 6 documents:

```
[component]/docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                    # Comprehensive feature and requirements analysis
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md       # One feature per objective (no code examples)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md         # Centralized file organization reference
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ARCHITECTURE.md              # SOLID/DRY principles + anti-pattern prevention
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ API_REFERENCE.md             # Complete interface documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CODE_EXAMPLES.md             # Implementation pattern examples
```

### **Critical Requirements**

1. **Documentation-First Development**: ALL documentation must be completed BEFORE any implementation begins
2. **One Feature Per Objective**: Implementation plans must have exactly one feature per objective
3. **Code Example Separation**: No code examples in planning documents - they belong in CODE_EXAMPLES.md
4. **App Folder Structure**: All application code goes in `[component]/app/` subfolder, not at root level
5. **Clean Architecture Enforcement**: All documents must stress SOLID principles and anti-pattern prevention

All application code MUST be organized as:

```
[component]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                        # Documentation (6 files)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app/                         # All application code
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json             # Dependencies and scripts
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [all config files]       # Configuration files
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                     # Source code
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                   # Test files
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/                 # Build/utility scripts
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [build output dirs]      # Dist, build, etc.
```

##### **Required Sections**

**CRITICAL: PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md MUST CONTAIN ONLY FILE PATHS FOR PARSER COMPATIBILITY**

The PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md document serves as input to the project generation tool and MUST contain ONLY the FILE_LIST section. Any additional content will break the parser.

**Required Content:**
- Brief document title and purpose statement
- FILE_LIST section with grouped file paths
- NOTHING ELSE

**Example of Correct Format:**
```markdown
# Component Project Structure (Simple Format)

This document provides a simplified, parser-friendly version of the project structure.

## FILE_LIST

### Configuration Files
package.json
package-lock.json
tsconfig.json

### Platform Monitors - Windows (Objective 1)
src/monitors/windows/WindowsMonitor.ts
src/monitors/windows/WinRTWrapper.ts
src/monitors/windows/PermissionHandler.ts

### Platform Monitors - Linux (Objective 2)  
src/monitors/linux/LinuxMonitor.ts
src/monitors/linux/DBusWrapper.ts
src/monitors/linux/DesktopDetector.ts

### Test Files - Unit Tests - Monitors
tests/unit/monitors/windows/WindowsMonitor.test.ts
tests/unit/monitors/linux/LinuxMonitor.test.ts
```

**‚ùå NEVER INCLUDE THESE SECTIONS (THEY BREAK THE GENERATOR):**
- Module Dependencies & Import Structure
- Component Organization
- File Naming Conventions  
- Build & Development Structure
- Dependency Hierarchy
- Import Rules
- Any explanatory text beyond file paths

**‚ùå NEVER USE TREE STRUCTURE FORMAT:**
```markdown
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ monitors/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ windows/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WindowsMonitor.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ WinRTWrapper.ts
```

**FILE_LIST Requirements:**
- Use simplified list format (not tree structure) for parser compatibility
- Group files by category with descriptive headers
- Include objective references for traceability  
- List all files exactly as they will be created
- NO additional sections or explanatory content

---

## üöÄ Project Generation Workflow

After all documentation is complete, the project structure is generated automatically using existing tooling.

### **Generation Process**

1. **Complete Documentation**: All 6 required documents must be finished
2. **Parser Reads Structure**: Tool parses the FILE_LIST from PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
3. **Generate Structure**: Tool creates the complete `app/` folder structure
4. **Scaffold Files**: Tool creates files with appropriate boilerplate/interfaces

### **Expected Final Structure After Generation**

### **Generation Requirements**

#### **Documentation Prerequisites**

- [ ] All 6 documentation files exist and are complete
- [ ] PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md uses simplified FILE_LIST format
- [ ] All file paths in PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md are under app/ subfolder
- [ ] CODE_EXAMPLES.md provides implementation patterns for scaffolding

#### **Tool Compatibility**

- [ ] PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md uses parser-compatible simplified format
- [ ] File paths are listed without tree structure formatting
- [ ] Files grouped by category with descriptive headers
- [ ] Objective references included for traceability

### **Post-Generation Development**

#### **Implementation Phase**

1. **Review Generated Structure**: Verify all files and folders created correctly
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in the app/ folder
3. **Follow Implementation Plan**: Implement features following the 15 objectives
4. **Use Code Examples**: Reference CODE_EXAMPLES.md for implementation patterns
5. **Follow Architecture Guidelines**: Apply SOLID principles from ARCHITECTURE.md

#### **Quality Assurance**

- Test infrastructure ready to use immediately
- Configuration files properly set up
- Development environment functional
- Build system configured and working
- All placeholder files have appropriate boilerplate

## üìù Implementation Notes

This documentation requirements specification ensures that the BeepMyPhone project will have:

- **Comprehensive Planning**: Every feature thoroughly planned before implementation
- **Clean Architecture**: SOLID principles and anti-patterns enforced throughout
- **Maintainable Structure**: Clear file organization and component boundaries
- **Quality Assurance**: Measurable standards and review processes
- **Implementation Guidance**: Practical code examples supporting development

Following these requirements will result in a well-architected, maintainable, and thoroughly documented application that serves as a model for professional software development practices.
