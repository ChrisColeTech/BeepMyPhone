# PC to Phone Notification Solution

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive solution for sending Windows PC notifications directly to mobile phones without relying on third-party cloud services like Firebase, AWS, or Azure. The solution is designed to be self-hosted, secure, and privacy-focused.

## Architecture

### High-Level Components

1. **Windows Notification Monitor (.NET Service)**
   - Monitors all Windows toast notifications system-wide
   - Filters and processes notifications based on user-defined rules
   - Sends notifications to the self-hosted push server

2. **Self-Hosted Push Server (ntfy.sh)**
   - Lightweight HTTP-based pub-sub notification service
   - Handles device registration and message routing
   - Provides real-time delivery via WebSocket/HTTP

3. **Mobile Apps (Android/iOS)**
   - Native applications that receive push notifications
   - Device registration and configuration management
   - Background notification processing

### Network Architecture

```
[Windows PC] → [Local Network] → [Self-Hosted ntfy Server] → [Mobile Apps]
```

## Solution Components

### 1. Windows Notification Monitor (.NET)

#### Technology Stack
- **.NET 8.0** - Latest LTS framework
- **Windows App SDK** - For UserNotificationListener API
- **Background Service** - Windows Service for continuous monitoring

#### Key Features
- **System-wide notification capture** using UserNotificationListener API
- **Real-time processing** with configurable filters
- **Rule-based filtering** (app-specific, keyword-based, time-based)
- **Secure communication** with HTTPS/TLS
- **Retry mechanism** for failed deliveries
- **Local configuration** with JSON/XML settings

#### Implementation Approach

```csharp
// Core notification monitoring service
public class NotificationMonitorService : BackgroundService
{
    private UserNotificationListener _listener;
    private NotificationProcessor _processor;
    private PushClient _pushClient;

    protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
    {
        // Monitor notifications using UserNotificationListener
        // Process and filter notifications
        // Send to ntfy server
    }
}
```

#### Required Capabilities
- **User Notification Listener** capability in app manifest
- **User permission** during first-run experience
- **Windows 10 Anniversary Update** (Build 14393) or later

### 2. Self-Hosted Push Server (ntfy.sh)

#### Why ntfy.sh?
- **Simple HTTP API** - Works with any HTTP client
- **Self-hosted** - Complete privacy and control
- **Cross-platform** - Android, iOS, desktop support
- **Real-time delivery** - WebSocket support
- **No external dependencies** - No cloud services required
- **Docker support** - Easy deployment

#### Setup with Docker

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  ntfy:
    image: binwiederhier/ntfy
    container_name: ntfy
    command:
      - serve
    environment:
      - NTFY_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
      - NTFY_LISTEN_HTTP=:8080
      - NTFY_BEHIND_PROXY=false
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./ntfy-data:/var/lib/ntfy
    restart: unless-stopped
```

#### API Usage

```bash
# Send notification via HTTP
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/pc-notifications \
  -H "Title: New Email" \
  -H "Priority: default" \
  -d "You have a new email from John Doe"
```

### 3. Mobile Applications

#### Android App (ntfy client)
- **Download**: Available on Google Play Store or F-Droid
- **Features**: Background delivery, custom sounds, vibration patterns
- **Configuration**: Subscribe to topics (e.g., "pc-notifications")

#### iOS App (ntfy client)

- **Features**: Push notifications, background app refresh
- **Configuration**: Topic subscription and notification preferences

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. **Set up ntfy server** using Docker
2. **Configure mobile apps** to subscribe to notification topics
3. **Test basic HTTP notification delivery**

### Phase 2: Windows Service Development
1. **Create .NET background service** project
2. **Implement UserNotificationListener** for system-wide monitoring
3. **Add HTTP client** for ntfy communication
4. **Implement basic filtering** rules

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. **Rule-based filtering system**
   - App whitelist/blacklist
   - Keyword filtering
   - Time-based rules (do not disturb)
   - Priority levels

2. **Configuration management**
   - Web-based configuration UI
   - JSON/XML configuration files
   - Hot-reload configuration changes

3. **Security enhancements**
   - End-to-end encryption
   - Authentication tokens
   - Rate limiting

### Phase 4: Mobile Integration
1. **Device registration** system
2. **Multiple device support**
3. **Device-specific filtering**
4. **Two-way communication** (acknowledgments, replies)

## Configuration

### Windows Service Configuration

```json
{
  "ntfy": {
    "serverUrl": "http://localhost:8080",
    "topic": "pc-notifications",
    "timeout": 30
  },
  "filters": {
    "allowedApps": ["Outlook", "Teams", "Chrome"],
    "blockedApps": ["Windows Security", "Windows Update"],
    "keywords": {
      "block": ["spam", "advertisement"],
      "prioritize": ["urgent", "important"]
    },
    "schedule": {
      "doNotDisturb": {
        "enabled": true,
        "start": "22:00",
        "end": "07:00"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Device Registration

```json
{
  "devices": [
    {
      "id": "phone-1",
      "name": "iPhone 15",
      "topic": "pc-notifications-iphone",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "id": "tablet-1", 
      "name": "iPad",
      "topic": "pc-notifications-ipad",
      "enabled": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Network Security
- **Local network deployment** - No internet exposure required
- **HTTPS/TLS encryption** for all communications
- **Authentication tokens** for device access
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse

### 2. Privacy Protection
- **No cloud dependencies** - All data stays local
- **Configurable data retention** - Automatic message cleanup
- **End-to-end encryption** option for sensitive notifications
- **Audit logging** for security monitoring

### 3. Access Control
- **Device whitelisting** - Only registered devices receive notifications
- **Topic-based permissions** - Fine-grained access control
- **Session management** - Token expiration and renewal

## Alternative Solutions Evaluated

### 1. KDE Connect
- **Pros**: Direct device-to-device communication, open source
- **Cons**: Limited Windows support, requires both devices on same network
- **Verdict**: Good for Linux environments, suboptimal for Windows

### 2. Microsoft Phone Link
- **Pros**: Native Windows integration, official Microsoft solution
- **Cons**: Requires Microsoft cloud services, limited customization
- **Verdict**: Not suitable for cloud-free requirement

### 3. Custom WebSocket Solution
