## Quality Assurance Strategy

### Code Quality Standards

**TypeScript Compliance**:
- Strict TypeScript configuration enforced
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors required
- Type definitions for all public APIs

**Testing Requirements**:
- Unit tests for all components and services
- Integration tests for cross-component functionality
- End-to-end tests for critical user workflows
- Minimum 80% code coverage

**Performance Standards**:
- Frontend components render within 16ms
- Backend API responses under 100ms
- WebSocket message latency under 50ms
- Memory usage under 100MB during normal operation

### Architecture Compliance

**SOLID Principles Verification**:
- Single Responsibility: Each component has one clear purpose
- Open/Closed: Extension through configuration, not modification
- Liskov Substitution: Interface compliance verified through testing
- Interface Segregation: Minimal, focused interfaces
- Dependency Inversion: Proper abstraction usage

**Component Size Limits**:
- React components: Maximum 120 lines
- Service classes: Maximum 150 lines
- Test files: Maximum 200 lines
- Functions: Maximum 20 lines

### Deployment Strategy

**Build Verification**:
- All phases must pass build verification before completion
