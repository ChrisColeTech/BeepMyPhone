# BeepMyPhone Project Overview

## Project Purpose

BeepMyPhone is a simple PC-to-phone notification forwarding system that captures notifications from desktop computers and forwards them to paired mobile devices over network connections.

## Core Functionality

**What it does:** Captures PC notifications (Windows/Linux/macOS) and forwards them to mobile devices in real-time.

**What it does NOT do:** Complex filtering, enterprise monitoring, advanced analytics, or cloud-based services.

## Architecture Components

### Backend (Node.js/TypeScript)
- **PC Notification Monitoring**: Cross-platform notification capture
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time communication with mobile devices
- **Device Management**: Simple device registration and status tracking
- **HTTP API**: Basic REST endpoints for device operations
- **Notification Forwarding**: Connect PC notifications to mobile delivery

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- **Desktop UI**: Simple desktop application interface
- **Device Management**: Add/remove/monitor mobile devices
- **Connection Status**: Backend service and device connectivity
- **Settings**: Basic preferences and configuration
- **Testing**: Send test notifications and view activity

### Mobile Integration
- **Not implemented yet**: Will need mobile apps or integration with existing services

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Web Server**: Express.js for HTTP API
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for WebSocket communication
- **Database**: SQLite for simple local storage
- **Authentication**: Simple device tokens (not JWT)

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for UI components
- **State**: React Context and React Query

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Simplicity Over Enterprise Complexity
- **5 backend objectives** instead of 15+ enterprise objectives
- **5 frontend objectives** instead of 44+ enterprise UI components
- **Simple device tokens** instead of complex JWT authentication
- **No filtering systems** - forward all captured notifications
- **No advanced analytics** - basic activity feed only

### SOLID Principles Applied Appropriately
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Extensible through configuration, not modification
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions where it makes sense
- **Interface Segregation**: Minimal interfaces for actual needs
- **Liskov Substitution**: Components substitutable with same interface

### Anti-Patterns Avoided
- **No God Objects**: Small, focused components
- **No Monster Components**: Size limits enforced (100-150 lines max)
- **No Spaghetti Code**: Clear separation of concerns
- **No Over-Engineering**: Match complexity to actual problem

## Current Status

### Backend
- **Documentation**: ✅ Complete (5 objectives documented)
- **Generator**: ✅ Working (55 files, compiles successfully)
- **Implementation**: ❌ Not started

### Frontend  
- **Documentation**: ✅ Complete (5 objectives documented)
- **Generator**: ⚠️ Not tested yet (28 files planned)
- **Implementation**: ❌ Not started

### Mobile
- **Documentation**: ❌ Not started
- **Implementation**: ❌ Not started

## Lessons Learned

### Requirements Simplification
1. **Challenge Enterprise Complexity**: Question features that don't serve the core use case
2. **Filtering Doesn't Make Sense**: If notifications appear on PC, user wants them forwarded
3. **Match Solution to Problem**: Simple notification forwarding doesn't need enterprise patterns

### Technical Implementation
1. **Fix Generators, Not Output**: Always fix the source of generated code
2. **Test Generation Immediately**: Verify generated code compiles
3. **Documentation Serves Tools**: Keep formats parser-compatible

### Architecture Insights
1. **5 Objectives Maximum**: For simple applications, more than 5 objectives indicates over-complexity
2. **Simple Authentication**: Device tokens sufficient for PC-to-phone communication
3. **Direct Implementation**: Repository patterns and complex abstractions often unnecessary

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Implementation**: Follow 5-objective plan
2. **Frontend Implementation**: Follow 5-objective plan  
3. **Mobile Strategy**: Define mobile app or service integration approach
4. **Desktop Integration**: System tray, auto-start, native notifications
5. **Testing**: End-to-end testing of notification flow
