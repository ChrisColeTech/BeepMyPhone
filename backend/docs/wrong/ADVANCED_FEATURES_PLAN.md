- **Never stop to ask "should I fix this?"** - If you discover advanced feature issues, **FIX THEM**
- **Feature Issues**: WebSocket errors, queue failures, network problems - **FIX THEM ALL**
- **Build Issues**: If `npm run build` fails, **FIX THE ERRORS** until build passes

## üèóÔ∏è Clean Architecture Enforcement

### SOLID Principles Application

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **WebSocket Components**: Server, connection manager, auth each handle single concern
- **Queue System**: Queue, priority queue, retry logic, dead letter each focused
- **Filtering Engine**: Rule engine, content filter, app filter each specialized
- **Discovery System**: mDNS, UDP broadcast, network detection each targeted

#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **WebSocket Events**: New event types through handler extension
- **Queue Types**: New queue implementations through interface extension
- **Filter Rules**: New rule types through rule engine extension
- **Discovery Methods**: New discovery protocols through service extension

#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **Queue Implementations**: All queues implement IQueue consistently
- **Event Handlers**: All handlers implement IEventHandler
- **Filters**: All filters implement IFilter interface
- **Discovery Services**: All discovery services substitutable

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **WebSocket Interfaces**: Separate interfaces for server, connection, auth
- **Queue Interfaces**: Focused interfaces for queue, retry, persistence
- **Filter Interfaces**: Specific interfaces for rule, content, application filtering
- **Discovery Interfaces**: Separate interfaces for advertisement, discovery, network

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- **WebSocket Services**: Depend on connection and auth interfaces
- **Queue Services**: Depend on storage and retry interfaces
- **Filter Services**: Depend on rule and evaluation interfaces
- **Discovery Services**: Depend on network and protocol interfaces

### Anti-Pattern Prevention Rules

#### Spaghetti Code Prevention
- **Clear Service Boundaries**: WebSocket, queue, filter, discovery modules separated
- **Interface Contracts**: All interactions through well-defined interfaces
- **Event Flow**: Clear event flow from notification to delivery
- **Service Communication**: Services communicate through defined protocols

#### Monster Class Prevention
- **Service Size**: Maximum 200 lines per service class
- **Method Complexity**: Maximum 50 lines per method
- **Feature Separation**: Large features split into focused services
- **Component Responsibilities**: Each component handles single advanced feature

#### God Object Prevention
- **Service Decomposition**: Advanced features split into focused services
- **State Management**: Service-specific state management
- **Configuration**: Feature-specific configuration management
- **Resource Management**: Each service manages its own resources

### Component Size Limits
