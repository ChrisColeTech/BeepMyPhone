# BeepMyPhone PC Notification Capture Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation of the core BeepMyPhone functionality: **capturing system notifications on PC and forwarding them to mobile devices**. This is NOT a web server - it's a lightweight desktop service that monitors OS notifications.

## üéØ Core Application Purpose

**BeepMyPhone** captures notifications from your PC (Windows/macOS/Linux) and forwards them to your phone in real-time. Think Pushbullet or KDE Connect - simple, direct, no web servers or user accounts needed.

## üì± Application Architecture

### **Desktop Service (Core Component)**
- **Background service** that runs in system tray
- **Platform-specific notification hooks** (Windows UserNotificationListener, macOS Notification Center, Linux D-Bus)
- **Direct communication** with paired mobile devices
- **Simple pairing** via QR code or local network discovery

### **Mobile Apps**
- **iOS app** to receive and display forwarded notifications
- **Android app** to receive and display forwarded notifications
- **Push notification** integration for reliable delivery

### **Communication**
- **Direct Wi-Fi connection** when devices are on same network
- **Firebase/APNs relay** when devices are on different networks
- **End-to-end encryption** for security

## üö´ What This App is NOT

- **NOT a web server** - No Express, no APIs, no user accounts
- **NOT a database app** - No SQLite, no user data storage  
- **NOT a messaging platform** - No chat, no social features
- **NOT enterprise software** - No complex authentication, no admin panels

## ‚úÖ What This App IS

- **Desktop utility** - Runs in background, captures notifications
- **Direct communication** - PC talks directly to phone
- **Simple pairing** - QR code scan, done
- **Lightweight** - Under 100MB total, minimal CPU/memory usage
- **Private** - No data leaves your devices (except through encrypted relay)

## üéØ Success Criteria

When complete, BeepMyPhone should:
1. **Capture all PC notifications** without interfering with normal display
2. **Forward to paired phones** within 1 second on local network
3. **Work across platforms** - Windows/macOS/Linux PCs, iOS/Android phones
4. **Simple setup** - Scan QR code, notifications start flowing
5. **Reliable delivery** - Use direct connection + cloud relay backup
6. **Respect privacy** - End-to-end encryption, no data collection

This is a focused utility app, not an enterprise platform. The implementation should reflect this simplicity while maintaining reliability and security.
