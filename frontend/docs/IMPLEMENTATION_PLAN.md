# Frontend Implementation Plan

## üìù TERMINOLOGY GUIDE

**To avoid confusion, this document uses consistent terminology:**

- **üéØ Objectives**: High-level goals listed in this document (Objective 1, 2, 3, etc.)
  - These are strategic areas requiring analysis and planning before implementation
  - Most objectives require breaking down into multiple implementation steps
- **üîß Steps**: Standard implementation work breakdown for each objective
  - **Step 1: Analysis & Discovery** - Examine code to understand specific issues and patterns
  - **Step 2: Design & Planning** - Determine technical approach and create implementation plan
  - **Step 3: Implementation** - Execute the planned code changes with build verification
  - **Step 4: Testing & Validation** - Verify functionality works correctly after changes
  - **Step 5: Documentation & Tracking** - Create lessons learned doc and update remediation plan
  - **Step 6: Git & Deployment Workflow** - Commit, push, and deploy via CI/CD pipeline
  - **Step 7: Quality Assurance Final Check** - Verify all completion requirements are met
- **‚úÖ Subtasks**: Specific actionable items within each step
  - Each step contains multiple subtasks that must be completed
  - Subtasks are the actual work items that can be checked off
  - Example: Step 1 might have subtasks like "Audit error handling patterns", "Catalog parsing violations", etc.
- **üìö Phase Documentation**: Completion documentation files (Phases 1-13 for frontend)
  - `PHASE_01_APPLICATION_LAYOUT.md` (Example frontend phase)

**Summary**: Work on each **Objective** involves multiple **steps** and results in **Phase documentation** when complete.

## üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION TOOLS & REQUIREMENTS

### **üìã MANDATORY PRE-WORK FOR ALL OBJECTIVES**

**Before beginning ANY objective work, you MUST:**

1. **üìñ Read Project Knowledge Base**

   - **Location**: `/mnt/c/Projects/BeepMyPhone/docs/summaries/`
   - **Requirement**: Read ALL relevant project knowledge documents
   - **Purpose**: Understand existing architecture, patterns, and decisions
   - **Files to Review**: All `.md` files in summaries directory for context

2. **üìö Read Complete Remediation Plan**
   - **This Document**: `/mnt/c/Projects/BeepMyPhone/frontend/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
   - **Understanding**: Methodology, terminology, success criteria
   - **Context**: How current objective fits into overall remediation strategy

### **‚ö° REQUIRED ANALYSIS TOOLS**

**Use Serena MCP Tools for ALL code analysis and updates:**

- **üéØ Project Activation**: **ALWAYS** activate the `BeepMyPhone` project first:

  ```
  mcp__serena__activate_project: project = "BeepMyPhone"
  ```

  - **CRITICAL**: Use "BeepMyPhone" (root project), NOT "frontend" or other subprojects
  - This ensures access to correct project memories and context
  - Verify activation shows BeepMyPhone specific memories and tools

- **üîç Code Analysis**: Use `mcp__serena__search_for_pattern`, `mcp__serena__find_symbol`, `mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview`
- **üìä Code Understanding**: Use `mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols` to understand dependencies
- **‚úèÔ∏è Code Updates**: Use `mcp__serena__replace_symbol_body`, `mcp__serena__insert_after_symbol`, etc.
- **üíæ Knowledge Management**: Use `mcp__serena__write_memory`, `mcp__serena__read_memory` for findings

**Benefits of Using Serena Tools:**

- **Accuracy**: Symbol-level precision prevents errors
- **Efficiency**: Faster than manual file reading and editing
- **Context**: Better understanding of code relationships
- **Consistency**: Standardized approach across all objectives

### **üéØ IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH**

**Required Process for Each Objective:**

1. **Knowledge Gathering**: Read project summaries + remediation plan
2. **Tool-Assisted Analysis**: Use Serena MCP tools for code examination
3. **Systematic Implementation**: Follow 7-step methodology
4. **Documentation**: Create phase documentation with lessons learned
5. **Quality Assurance**: Verify all completion criteria

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Using proper tools and reading project context is mandatory for successful objective completion. This ensures accuracy, maintains consistency, and leverages established architectural knowledge.

### **üöÄ AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS**

**CRITICAL: Agents must complete objectives autonomously without stopping to ask questions.**

**üõ≠ FIX ALL ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:**

- **Never stop to ask "should I fix this?"** - If you discover issues during your objective work, **FIX THEM**
- **Scope Boundary**: Fix any issues **within your objective scope** - don't hesitate
- **Code Issues**: TypeScript errors, interface mismatches, missing methods, type conflicts - **FIX THEM ALL**
- **Build Issues**: If `npm run build` fails due to your changes, **FIX THE ERRORS** until build passes
- **Integration Issues**: If services don't integrate properly, **FIX THE INTEGRATION**

**‚ùó DO NOT STOP FOR:**

- TypeScript compilation errors - Fix them
- Missing interface methods - Add them
- Type mismatches - Resolve them
- Build failures - Fix them
- Integration problems - Solve them

**üéØ COMPLETE ALL 7 STEPS:**

- **Step 5**: Documentation & Tracking - **MANDATORY** update of remediation plan tracking table
- **Step 6**: Git & Deployment - **MANDATORY** commit ALL changes and push via CI/CD
- **Step 7**: Quality Assurance - **MANDATORY** verify ALL completion criteria

**üéØ GOAL**: Complete objective with working code, passing build, complete documentation, and updated tracking.

### **üö® MANDATORY COMPLETION VERIFICATION FOR HAIKU AGENTS**

**CRITICAL**: Due to Haiku agent limitations, these verification steps are MANDATORY before claiming completion:

**üìã COMPLETION CHECKLIST - ALL MUST BE VERIFIED:**

1. **‚úÖ Code Changes Verification**:

   - Run `git status` and verify files were actually modified
   - Run `git diff` and verify the changes match the objective scope
   - Verify ALL changed files are staged with `git add .`

2. **‚úÖ Build Verification**:

   - Run `npm run build` and verify ZERO TypeScript errors
   - If build fails, DO NOT claim completion until fixed
   - Screenshot or copy the build success output

3. **‚úÖ Documentation Creation**:

   - Create `/mnt/c/Projects/BeepMyPhone/frontend/docs/phases/PHASE_0X_OBJECTIVE_NAME.md` (Phases 1-13)
   - Include quantified results, technical details, and architectural insights
   - Verify the file exists with `ls -la /mnt/c/Projects/BeepMyPhone/frontend/docs/phases/PHASE_0*`

4. **‚úÖ Tracking Table Update**:

   - Open `/mnt/c/Projects/BeepMyPhone/frontend/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
   - Find the objective in the tracking table
   - Change status from "‚ùå **NOT STARTED**" to "‚úÖ **COMPLETED**"
   - Verify the change with `grep "Objective XX.*COMPLETED" /mnt/c/Projects/BeepMyPhone/frontend/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

5. **‚úÖ Git Workflow Completion**:

   - Run `git add .` to stage all changes
   - Run `git commit -m "Phase 0X: Objective Name - [summary]"` (Phases 1-13)
   - Run `git push origin main`
   - Verify commit with `git log --oneline | head -1`

6. **‚úÖ CI/CD Verification**:
   - Run `gh run list --limit 1` to get latest run ID
   - Monitor with `gh run watch [run-id]` until completion
   - Verify successful deployment

**üö´ DO NOT CLAIM COMPLETION UNLESS ALL 6 STEPS VERIFIED SUCCESSFUL**

**If ANY step fails, the objective is NOT complete - continue working until ALL steps pass.**

## üèóÔ∏è Clean Architecture Enforcement

### SOLID Principles Application

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each component handles exactly one concern:

- Layout components manage only UI structure
- Device components manage only device-related functionality
- Status components manage only connection/service status
- Settings components manage only configuration options

**Enforcement:** Component size limited to 120 lines maximum including imports and exports.

#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Components extend functionality through:

- Props interfaces for configuration
- Composition patterns for feature extension
- Configuration objects for behavior modification
- Plugin patterns for extensible functionality

**Enforcement:** New features added through composition, not modification.

#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Interface contracts ensure substitutability:

- Components with same props interface are interchangeable
- Hooks with same return interface are substitutable
- Services with same contract are replaceable

**Enforcement:** Strict TypeScript interfaces prevent contract violations.

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Focused interfaces prevent unnecessary dependencies:

- Component props limited to 3 properties maximum
- Hook interfaces specific to use case
- Service contracts minimal and focused

**Enforcement:** Interface size limits enforced through TypeScript and code review.

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level components depend on abstractions:

- Components depend on props interfaces, not implementations
- Hooks depend on service contracts, not concrete services
- Services depend on configuration abstractions

**Enforcement:** Dependency injection patterns and interface abstractions required.

### Anti-Pattern Prevention Rules

#### Spaghetti Code Prevention

- Clear component boundaries with single responsibility
- Unidirectional data flow requirements
- Explicit dependency declarations
- Component coupling minimization through interfaces

#### Monster Class Prevention

- Component size limit: 120 lines maximum
- Function length limit: 15 lines maximum
- Cyclomatic complexity limit: 6 maximum
- Props interface limit: 3 properties maximum

#### God Object Prevention

- Responsibility distribution across focused components
- Service decomposition into single-purpose modules
- State management boundaries clearly defined
- Component composition over inheritance

### Component Size Limits

- **React Components:** 120 lines maximum including imports/exports
- **Custom Hooks:** 80 lines maximum including helper functions
- **Service Files:** 150 lines maximum including all methods
- **Test Files:** 150 lines maximum, split into multiple files if exceeded
- **Utility Functions:** 50 lines maximum per function

### Quality Gates

- **TypeScript Strict:** All code compiles with strict mode enabled
- **ESLint Clean:** Zero ESLint errors, maximum 2 warnings per file
- **Test Coverage:** Minimum 80% line coverage for all components
- **Performance:** Component render time under 16ms
- **Bundle Size:** Individual component chunks under 50KB compressed
