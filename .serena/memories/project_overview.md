# BeepMyPhone Project Overview

## Purpose
BeepMyPhone is a PC-to-phone notification forwarding system that captures notifications on PC and sends them to paired mobile devices over network connections (not limited to local networks). The system operates without cloud services, providing simple notification forwarding with device token authentication.

## Key Characteristics
- Simple notification forwarding without cloud services
- Network-based communication (not limited to local network)
- Desktop application with Electron frontend
- Mobile app integration (planned)
- Simplified from complex enterprise requirements to 5 core objectives per component

## Project Architecture
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express TypeScript server (5 objectives)
- **Frontend**: React/Vite TypeScript application (5 objectives) 
- **Electron**: Desktop app wrapper
- **Mobile**: iOS/Android apps (not started)
- **Tools**: Python-based structure generators

## Current Status
- Backend: ✅ 55 files generated, compiles successfully
- Frontend: ✅ 28 files, documentation complete
- Mobile: ❌ Not started
- Infrastructure: ✅ Serena MCP configured and ready

## Implementation Approach
- Documentation-first development
- 10-phase implementation (Phases 1-5 backend, 6-10 frontend)
- SOLID principles and clean architecture enforcement
- One feature per implementation objective
